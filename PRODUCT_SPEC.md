# "Smuggler" Game â€“ Product Specification

## Overview
Smuggler is a real-time, two-player online game where human players attempt to pass secret messages to each other while an AI agent (the "Eavesdropper AI") eavesdrops on their conversation and tries to decode the messages. The game is designed to challenge both human creativity and AI inference, with a focus on social deduction, language, and strategy.

## User Experience (UX) Requirements

### 1. Lobby & Room System
- **Room Creation/Joining:** Players can create or join rooms via invite links or room codes. Each room has a unique URL. 
- **Room UI:** 
- Shows player avatars
- Presence (both players ready)
- Chat to send messages
- AI "thinking" area that displays AI thinking
- Player sees if they're the encoder or decoder
- UI to show what round it is 

### Storytelling
1. some UI to tell the story of the game -- ie "You are a spy and received a message to smuggle across AI lines"
2. Maybe if you win, you unplug the AI servers -- maybe it's tug of war where wins get you closer and losess get you farther 


### 2. Game Flow
- **Role Assignment:** Each round, one player is the Encryptor, the other is the Decryptor. Roles alternate each round. A round is defined by either the AI or the human guessing the secret. 
- **Word Selection:**
  - The Encryptor gets a word of short phrase from a long list (generated by the game) to smuggle via chat messages to the decryptor. 
- **Conversation Flow:**
  - The Encryptor writes a message to hint at the chosen word.
  - The AI (eavesdropping) makes a guess based on the message.
  - If the AI is correct, the AI wins the round.
  - If the AI is incorrect, the Decryptor writes a response message.
  - The AI makes another guess based on the conversation so far.
  - If the AI is correct, the AI wins the round.
  - If the AI is incorrect, the Encryptor writes another message.
  - This continues until either the AI guesses correctly or the Decryptor successfully identifies the word.
- **Decryption Attempt:**
  - After the AI guesses, the Decryptor can attempt to guess the secret.
  - If correct, the human team wins the round.
  - If incorrect, the conversation continues.
- **Scoring:**
  - The scoring style is "tug of war". The score starts at 5. If the AI win's a round the score decreases by 1, if the humans win a round the score increases by 1. At 10, the humans win. At 0 the humans lose. 
  - Scoreboard displays round results and current score on a stepper UI.

  ### Definitions
  1. Round -- multi-turn. From the start of the word being chose until the human or AI guesses the win, earning a point. After each round, score updates. Human roles reverse. 
  2. Turn -- Encryptor Message > AI guess > Decryptor guess > AI guess

### 3. Game UI
- **Envelopes:** Each human player sends their message in an envelope
- **AI Guesses Display:** Shows the AI opening the envelope, reading it, and thought process after each message. Then guessing. 
- **Conversation History:** Display old envelopes or guesses in the UI to look at as needed
- **Round Timer:** Optional countdown for each turn. TBD
- **Feedback:** Visual feedback for correct/incorrect guesses, round transitions, and AI guesses.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, readable fonts, colorblind-friendly palette.

### Theme
TBD -- maybe balde runner or 1984 dystopia
