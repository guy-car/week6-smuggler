# React Native Text Component Error Resolution Attempts

## Original Issue
React Native error "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" occurring in the RoomScreen component when using Zustand store hooks during navigation to the room screen.

## Error Context
The error consistently appears during navigation from 'lobby' to 'room' screen, specifically around the Zustand store selector usage:
```typescript
const roomId = useGameStore(state => state.roomId);
```

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Memoized Selectors with useMemo
```typescript
// Create memoized selectors
const selectRoomId = useMemo(() => (state: any) => state.roomId, []);
const selectPlayers = useMemo(() => (state: any) => state.players, []);
const selectPlayer = useMemo(() => (state: any) => state.player, []);
const selectIsReady = useMemo(() => (state: any) => state.isReady, []);

// Use the memoized selectors
const roomId = useGameStore(selectRoomId);
const players = useGameStore(selectPlayers);
```
Result: Did not resolve the issue. Error persisted with the same message.

### 2. Direct Selectors Without Memoization
```typescript
const roomId = useGameStore(state => state.roomId);
const players = useGameStore(state => state.players);
const player = useGameStore(state => state.player);
const isReady = useGameStore(state => state.isReady);
```
Result: Error continued to occur during screen transition.

### 3. Custom Hook Pattern
```typescript
const useRoomData = () => {
    const store = useGameStore();
    return {
        roomId: store.roomId,
        players: store.players,
        player: store.player,
        isReady: store.isReady
    };
};

const RoomScreen = () => {
    const { roomId, players, player, isReady } = useRoomData();
    // ...
};
```
Result: Error still persists.

## Key Observations
1. Error occurs specifically during screen transitions
2. Error appears twice during each transition
3. Stack trace includes expo-router components (ScreenContentWrapper, RNSScreenStack)
4. Store data is valid (correct values for roomId, players, etc.)
5. Error is consistently tied to the store selector line regardless of implementation approach

## Potential Next Steps to Try
1. Higher-order component wrapper for store access
2. Render prop pattern implementation
3. React's useCallback for selectors
4. Investigation of store initialization timing
5. Examining expo-router's screen transition handling

## Technical Details
- Environment: React Native with Expo
- State Management: Zustand
- Navigation: expo-router
- Error Location: frontend/app/room/index.tsx

## Impact
The error appears to be a warning rather than a fatal error, as the application continues to function, but it indicates a potential issue with how React Native is handling the store selectors during screen transitions.
