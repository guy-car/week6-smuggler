# Sound Effects Implementation

## Current Implementation Overview
The game now features a comprehensive audio system with:
1. Button click sounds for UI interactions
2. Send/action sounds for important game actions
3. Background music that plays continuously across screens
4. Automatic volume ducking when sound effects play

## Audio Features

### Sound Types
1. UI Sounds:
   - `click_1.mp3` for general button interactions
   - `send_button_v1.mp3` for message sending/guessing
2. Background Music:
   - `lobby-sound.mp3` continuous background track
   - Plays across all game screens
   - Volume ducks during sound effects

### Volume Management
- Background Music: 50% base volume
- Sound Effects: 100% base volume
- Ducking: Background reduces to 30% during effects
- Ducking Duration: 500ms

### Platform Handling
- iOS: Plays in silent mode
- Android: Native audio ducking support
- Background Behavior: Pauses when app inactive

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. Sound Manager (frontend/utils/soundManager.ts):
```typescript
class SoundManager {
    private backgroundMusic: Audio.Sound | null = null;
    private sounds: Map<string, Audio.Sound> = new Map();
    private musicVolume: number = 0.5;
    private effectsVolume: number = 1.0;

    async initialize() {
        await Audio.setAudioModeAsync({
            playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
            staysActiveInBackground: false,
            shouldDuckAndroid: true,
        });
        // Load sounds and music...
    }

    async duckBackgroundMusic() {
        await this.backgroundMusic?.setVolumeAsync(this.musicVolume * 0.3);
        setTimeout(async () => {
            await this.backgroundMusic?.setVolumeAsync(this.musicVolume);
        }, 500);
    }
}
```

2. App Lifecycle Management (frontend/app/index.tsx):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize audio
    await soundManager.initialize();
    await soundManager.playBackgroundMusic();

    // Handle app state
    const subscription = AppState.addEventListener('change', (nextAppState) => {
        if (nextAppState === 'active') {
            soundManager.playBackgroundMusic();
        } else {
            soundManager.pauseBackgroundMusic();
        }
    });
}, []);
```

### Sound Hooks
1. `useButtonSound.ts` - For UI click sounds
2. `useSendSound.ts` - For send/action sounds

### Integration Points
Sound effects are integrated in:
- Lobby Screen (button clicks)
- Room Screen (ready/leave actions)
- Game Screens (message sending, guessing)
- Modal interactions
- Navigation actions

## Performance Optimizations
1. Single audio instance for background music
2. Preloaded and cached sound effects
3. Non-blocking sound playback
4. Optimized ducking implementation
5. Memory-efficient cleanup

## Best Practices Implemented
1. Centralized sound management
2. Proper platform-specific handling
3. Automatic cleanup on unmount
4. Error resilient playback
5. Responsive audio feedback
6. Background state management

## Future Considerations
1. Volume controls for music/effects
2. Additional sound variations
3. Screen-specific music tracks
4. Enhanced ducking patterns
5. Additional audio feedback for game events
