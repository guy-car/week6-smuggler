# Sound Effects Implementation

## Original Request
Add sound effects to button interactions in the game, specifically:
1. Initially requested to add sound to the Send button
2. Extended to add sound effects to all buttons in the game
3. Optimize sound playback to reduce delay

## Challenges
1. Initial implementation had noticeable delay between button click and sound playback
2. Sound not working on iOS devices
3. Each component was loading its own sound instance, causing memory inefficiency
4. Async/await operations were causing unnecessary delays

## Successes
1. Successfully implemented sound effects across all game buttons
2. Created a centralized sound management system
3. Improved sound playback responsiveness
4. Fixed iOS sound playback issues

## Methods That Did Not Work
1. Per-component sound loading:
   ```typescript
   const [sound, setSound] = useState<Audio.Sound | null>(null);
   useEffect(() => {
     const loadSound = async () => {
       const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(soundFile);
       setSound(sound);
     };
     loadSound();
   }, []);
   ```
2. Awaiting sound playback before executing button actions
3. Loading sounds on demand

## Methods That Worked
1. Global Sound Manager singleton pattern:
   - Preloads all sounds at app startup
   - Caches sounds in memory
   - Uses fire-and-forget playback
   - Handles proper cleanup

2. Optimized sound hooks:
   ```typescript
   export const useButtonSound = () => {
     return soundManager.playClick.bind(soundManager);
   };
   ```

3. Non-blocking sound playback:
   ```typescript
   playClick() {
     const sound = this.sounds.get('click');
     if (sound) {
       sound.replayAsync(); // Fire and forget
     }
   }
   ```

## Changes Made to Codebase

### New Files Created
1. `frontend/utils/soundManager.ts` - Global sound management singleton
2. `frontend/hooks/useButtonSound.ts` - Hook for click sound
3. `frontend/hooks/useSendSound.ts` - Hook for send sound

### Modified Files
1. `frontend/app/index.tsx` - Added sound initialization at app startup
2. Multiple component files updated to use sound hooks:
   - Lobby Screen
   - Room Screen
   - Encoder Game Screen
   - Decoder Game Screen
   - Round Modal
   - Connection Error Screen
   - Connection Troubleshooting Guide
   - Game End Screen

### Key Implementation Details
1. Sound Manager Features:
   - Singleton pattern for global state
   - Preloaded sound assets
   - Memory caching
   - iOS compatibility settings
   - Proper cleanup on unmount

2. Sound Types:
   - `send_button_v1.mp3` for message sending/guessing
   - `
   
   .mp3` for all other button interactions

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Pre-downloaded sounds
   - Optimized playback settings
   - Removed unnecessary async/await
   - Direct method calls for playback
   - Simplified error handling
