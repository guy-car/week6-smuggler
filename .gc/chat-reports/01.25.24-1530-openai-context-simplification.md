# OpenAI Context System Simplification

## Original Request
Simplify the game's conversation context system and AI analysis flow for a 30-second demo experience, removing storytelling elements and complex interactions.

## Frontend Data Requirements (For Brooks)
The frontend needs to collect and structure data in the following format for the OpenAI service:

```typescript
{
  gameId: string,  // Room/session identifier
  conversationHistory: [
    {
      type: 'encoder_hint',
      content: string,    // The hint message
      turnNumber: number  // Sequential starting from 1
    },
    {
      type: 'ai_analysis',
      thinking: string[4], // Previous AI's 4 thinking sentences
      guess: string,       // Previous AI's guess
      turnNumber: number   // Sequential
    },
    {
      type: 'decoder_guess',
      guess: string,      // Just the failed guess word
      turnNumber: number  // Sequential
    }
  ]
}
```

Key points for frontend implementation:
- Word validation (3-12 chars, lowercase) should be handled on frontend
- Failed guesses must be tracked in conversation history
- Successful guesses end the game (not included in history)
- Turn numbers must be sequential starting from 1
- Must follow strict turn order: encoder → ai → decoder → ai → encoder...

## Changes Made
1. **Simplified Game Flow**
   - Removed storytelling elements
   - Removed insider messages (now just guesses)
   - Removed suspicion level tracking
   - AI analyzes after every turn

2. **Type System Updates**
   - Created discriminated union for turn types
   - Added turn number tracking
   - Implemented turn sequence validation
   - Removed regex validation (moved to frontend)

3. **OpenAI Service Changes**
   - All conversation history sent as single user message
   - Clear labeling with [WORKER], [SPOUSE], [ANALYSIS]
   - Structured AI response format

## Challenges
- Balancing simplicity with game mechanics
- Maintaining turn sequence integrity
- Coordinating frontend/backend responsibilities

## Successful Approaches
- Using discriminated unions for type safety
- Moving validation responsibilities to appropriate layers
- Simplifying AI context to single user message

## Methods That Didn't Work
- Complex role mapping system
- Regex-based validation in backend
- Suspicion level tracking

## Next Steps
1. Frontend team to implement data collection structure
2. Update route handlers for new schema
3. Implement turn validation
4. Test with real game scenarios

## Technical Details
- Backend validates turn sequence and structure
- Frontend handles word constraints
- AI service processes conversation as chronological sequence
- Game state tracks turn numbers and sequence
