# Conversation Context Restructure - Turn-Based System

**STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS** 
Core schema defined, OpenAI integration tested, route handlers being updated.

## Overall Goal
Implement a simplified turn-based game flow that:
1. Maintains clear sequence: outsider → ai → insider → ai
2. Tracks conversation chronologically
3. Keeps game state management simple
4. Records failed guesses for AI context

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Type Definitions** (`backend/openai/types/game.ts`)
   ```typescript
   type Turn = 
     | OutsiderTurn  // hint message + optional turn number
     | AITurn        // thinking + guess + optional turn number
     | InsiderTurn   // guess + optional turn number
   ```

   Note: Turn numbers are now optional and will be phased out in a future update.
   Turn sequence validation moved to game handlers for simpler schema.

2. **OpenAI Service** (`backend/openai/services/openai.ts`)
   - ✅ Simplified context as single user message
   - ✅ Removed complex role mapping
   - ✅ Clear turn sequence validation
   - ✅ Removed suspicion level
   - ✅ Made turn numbers optional
   - ✅ Updated conversation formatting to use new turn types
   - ✅ Simplified schema (sequence validation moved to game logic)

3. **Route Handler** (`backend/openai/routes/ai.ts`)
   - ✅ Updated to use new `Turn[]` format with `gameId`
   - ✅ Removed metadata from response (suspicion level removed)
   - ✅ Updated error handling for turn validation
   - ✅ Clean response format matching `AIResponseSchema`

4. **Test File** (`backend/openai/test-openai.ts`)
   - ✅ Converted test scenarios to new `Turn[]` format
   - ✅ Removed suspicion level from test validations
   - ✅ Updated mock data to use new turn types
   - ✅ Added realistic game flow scenarios

5. **Game Flow**
   - ✅ Outsider sends hint → AI analyzes
   - ✅ If AI correct → Game Over
   - ✅ If AI wrong → Insider guesses
   - ✅ If Insider correct → Game Over
   - ✅ If Insider wrong → Add to history

### ⏳ Critical Files Still Needing Updates

#### 1. **Game Handlers** (`backend/src/socket/handlers/gameHandlers.ts`) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Current Issues:**
- Uses `MockAIService` instead of real OpenAI service
- Expects old AI response format with `confidence` field
- Game state uses old `Message[]` and `AIGuess[]` structures
- Turn management uses old roles ('encryptor'/'decryptor' vs 'outsider'/'insider')

**Required Changes:**
- Switch from `MockAIService` to real OpenAI service
- Update AI response handling to new format (no confidence/suspicion)
- Convert game state to use `Turn[]` format
- Implement turn sequence validation (moved from schema)
- Update role mapping: encryptor→outsider, decryptor→insider
- Remove complex game state persistence (keep it simple)

#### 2. **Main Game Types** (`backend/src/types/index.ts`) - HIGH PRIORITY
**Current Issues:**
- `GameState` uses old `Message[]` and `AIGuess[]` arrays
- Player roles are 'encryptor'/'decryptor' instead of 'outsider'/'insider'
- Complex game state structure not needed for simplified game

**Required Changes:**
- Update `GameState` to use single `Turn[]` array
- Change player roles to 'outsider'/'insider'
- Simplify game state (remove unnecessary fields)
- Add game end conditions
- Update interfaces for new flow

#### 3. **Mock AI Service** (`backend/src/ai/mock.ts`) - LOW PRIORITY (REMOVE)
**Current Issues:**
- No longer needed since we're using real OpenAI service
- Interface doesn't match new schema
- Adds unnecessary complexity

**Required Changes:**
- Remove file entirely OR update to match new interface for fallback
- Update any imports/references

### ⏳ In Progress
- Brooks working on integrating updated OpenAI service into game handlers
- Will implementing frontend data collection using new Turn structure

### Future Tasks
1. **Turn Number Refactoring**
   - Phase out turn numbers from game state management
   - Update all handlers to use array indices for turn order
   - Remove turn number validation
   - Update tests to not rely on turn numbers
   This will be handled in a separate PR to avoid mixing concerns.

## Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Integration
Frontend team needs to implement:
```typescript
{
  gameId: string,
  conversationHistory: [
    {
      type: 'outsider_hint',
      content: string,
      turnNumber: number
    },
    {
      type: 'ai_analysis',
      thinking: string[4],
      guess: string,
      turnNumber: number
    },
    {
      type: 'insider_guess',
      guess: string,
      turnNumber: number
    }
  ]
}
```

Key requirements:
- Word validation (3-12 chars, lowercase)
- Track failed guesses in history
- Maintain turn sequence
- Handle game end conditions

### 2. Backend Tasks - Priority Order
1. **Update OpenAI Service** (CRITICAL) - Remove suspicion level, fix turn types
2. **Update Route Handler** (HIGH) - New schema, remove metadata
3. **Update Game Handlers** (HIGH) - Switch to real AI service, new turn flow
4. **Update Main Types** (HIGH) - New game state structure
5. **Update Test File** (MEDIUM) - New test scenarios
6. **Remove/Update Mock AI** (LOW) - Clean up unused code

### 3. Testing Strategy
Test scenarios:
1. Complete game flow:
   ```typescript
   [
     { type: 'outsider_hint', content: "hot drink made from beans" },
     { type: 'ai_analysis', thinking: [...], guess: "coffee" },
     { type: 'insider_guess', guess: "tea" }
   ]
   ```

2. Error cases:
   - Invalid turn types
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid word lengths
   - Invalid guess formats

3. Game end conditions:
   - AI guesses correctly (immediate win)
   - Insider guesses correctly (win)
   - Multiple failed guesses tracked in history

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Simplified game flow implemented
- ✅ Type safety with Zod validation
- ✅ OpenAI service updated
- ✅ Route handlers simplified
- ⏳ Game handlers use real AI service
- ⏳ Turn sequence validation in game handlers
- ⏳ Frontend successfully integrated

## Team Responsibilities

### Brooks (Backend Lead)
- Integrate real OpenAI service into game handlers
- Implement turn sequence validation
- Update game state to use Turn[] format
- Clean up old mock services

### Will (Frontend Lead)
- Implement new data collection structure
- Update UI for simplified turn flow
- Handle game end conditions
- Track failed guesses in history

### Guillaume (OpenAI Integration)
- ✅ Update OpenAI service
- ✅ Implement new turn types
- ✅ Remove suspicion level
- ✅ Simplify response structure

## Critical Dependencies
1. **Game Handlers** (HIGH)
   - Needs OpenAI service integration ✅
   - Must implement turn sequence validation
   - Required for frontend integration

2. **Frontend Updates** (HIGH)
   - Needs final game handler API
   - Must handle new Turn[] format
   - Required for end-to-end testing

3. **Testing** (MEDIUM)
   - Needs all backend changes
   - Must verify game flow
   - Required for deployment

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Game handler integration (complex state management)
- **Medium Risk**: Frontend adaptation to new structure
- **Low Risk**: OpenAI service integration (completed) ✅
