# Post-Round Learning AI Implementation Progress

### Overall Goal [✓ Defined]
Implement dynamic AI learning within a single match:
1. After every round the backend calls OpenAI once more to analyse that round's conversation and return:
   • `analysis` – patterns/strategies players used (string)
   • `comment`  – a boast / humility sentence depending on the winner (string, ignored for now)
2. Store each `analysis` in-memory for the lifetime of the match so subsequent AI guesses can reference accumulated player behaviour.
3. Keep code changes confined to backend; no immediate frontend work required.

### Implementation Progress

#### ✓ COMPLETED:

1. **Extended backend types** [Step 1]
   - Added `previousRoundsAnalysis: string[]` to `GameState`
   - Made field required (not optional) since we always initialize it
   - Considered but decided against adding Zod schema for `GameState` as it's an internal interface
   - Location: `backend/src/types/index.ts`

2. **Seeded new property** [Step 2]
   - Added `previousRoundsAnalysis: []` initialization in `createGameState`
   - Location: `backend/src/game/state.ts`

3. **Added OpenAI helper** [Step 3]
   - Created separate `analyzeRoundStrategy` function for "liminal state" between rounds
   - Key decisions:
     • Separate API call from gameplay analysis (cleaner separation of concerns)
     • Uses `gpt-4o` model
     • Strict tool definition with clear word limits
     • Improved error messages with context
   - Location: `backend/openai/services/openai.ts`

4. **Invoke helper at round end** [Step 4]
   - Added round analysis in both handlers:
     • `handlePlayerGuess`: When player makes correct guess
     • `handleAIResponse`: When AI makes correct guess
   - Key implementation details:
     • Analysis happens after confirming round end but before score update
     • Non-blocking with clear error logging
     • Uses complete conversation history
     • Properly handles async/await
   - Location: `backend/src/socket/handlers/gameHandlers.ts`

#### 🚧 NEXT UP:

5. **Feed analysis into future prompts** [Step 5]
   - Location: `backend/openai/services/openai.ts`
   - Implementation details:
     • Update signature: `analyzeConversation(turns, previousAnalyses)`
     • Add to user message context:
       ```ts
       const previousAnalysesContext = previousAnalyses?.length 
         ? `\nPreviously observed player strategies:\n${previousAnalyses.join('\n')}\nBe on the lookout for similar approaches.`
         : '';
       ```
     • From `handleAIResponse`, pass `room.gameState.previousRoundsAnalysis`

#### ⏳ PENDING:

6. **Add debug logging**
   - Location: `backend/src/socket/handlers/gameHandlers.ts`
   - Implementation details:
     ```ts
     // After pushing new analysis:
     console.log(`[DEBUG] Round ${room.gameState.currentRound} analysis added:`, analysis);
     console.log(`[DEBUG] All analyses:`, room.gameState.previousRoundsAnalysis);

     // In analyzeConversation:
     if (previousAnalyses?.length > 0) {
       console.log(`[DEBUG] Using ${previousAnalyses.length} previous analyses in prompt:`, previousAnalyses);
     }
     ```

7. **House-keeping**
   - Update/add unit tests:
     • Verify `previousRoundsAnalysis` initializes empty
     • Verify array grows by 1 after round end
     • Test both win conditions (AI and players)
   - Run full test suite (`npm test`) to catch regressions
   - Review error handling for edge cases

8. **Optional frontend integration** (future)
   - Options for displaying taunt/comment:
     • Emit via `round_end` payload
     • Add `lastRoundComment` to `GameState`
   - Consider UI placement and animation
   - Handle potential undefined/null cases

### Technical Decisions & Learnings

1. **API Call Strategy**
   - Initially considered adding round analysis to existing `analyzeConversation` call
   - Decided on separate call because:
     • Cleaner separation between gameplay and analysis
     • Different timing (between rounds vs during gameplay)
     • More focused prompts for each purpose
     • Easier to maintain and debug

2. **Type Safety Approach**
   - Used TypeScript interfaces for internal types (`GameState`, `RoundSummary`)
   - Added Zod schemas only for API responses (`RoundAnalysis`)
   - Rationale: Zod needed for runtime validation of external data, TypeScript sufficient for internal types

3. **Code Organization**
   - Extracted prompt construction to private method
   - Used private readonly for tool definitions
   - Added specific error messages for better debugging
   - Maintained consistent conversation history formatting

### Challenges Addressed

1. **Tool Definition**
   - Made comment field required instead of optional
   - Added `strict: true` to enforce parameter constraints
   - Specific word limits (20 for analysis, 10 for comment)

2. **Context Management**
   - Moved previous analyses to user message instead of system prompt
   - Keeps system prompt focused on stable instructions
   - Better reflects the temporal nature of analysis history

3. **Error Handling**
   - Removed redundant tool name validation (since only one tool provided)
   - Added debug logging for analysis results
   - Prefixed errors with context for better tracing

### Next Steps
1. Implement round-end integration
2. Test with multiple rounds to verify analysis accumulation
3. Verify analysis affects subsequent AI behavior

### Open Questions
1. Should we add rate limiting between consecutive OpenAI calls?
2. How should we handle API failures between rounds?
3. Should we persist analyses across game restarts?
