# Background Music Implementation Action Plan

## Overall Goal
Implement background music system for the Smuggler game that plays contextual music based on game screens (lobby, room, game, end) without interfering with existing sound effects (click sounds, send sounds). The system should be performant, respect user preferences, and handle edge cases gracefully.

## Regression Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### HIGH RISK: Existing Sound Effects Interference
- **Risk**: Background music could conflict with click/send sounds, causing audio glitches or preventing sound effects from playing
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Use separate audio channels/instances for music vs. effects
  - Test all existing sound functionality after each implementation phase
  - Implement volume mixing (music lower volume, effects full volume)
  - Add fallback to disable music if conflicts detected

### MEDIUM RISK: Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Music files could cause memory issues, app slowdown, or battery drain
- **Mitigation**:
  - Preload only current screen's music, stream long tracks
  - Implement proper cleanup and memory management
  - Monitor app performance during testing
  - Add music quality/compression options

### MEDIUM RISK: Platform-Specific Issues
- **Risk**: iOS silent mode, Android background audio permissions, different audio behaviors
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android
  - Respect device silent mode settings
  - Handle app backgrounding/foregrounding properly
  - Follow platform audio guidelines

### LOW RISK: State Management Complexity
- **Risk**: Music state could get out of sync with game state, causing wrong music to play
- **Mitigation**:
  - Integrate with existing game state management
  - Add clear state transitions and logging
  - Implement defensive programming for edge cases

## Implementation Actions

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
**Files to alter:**
- `frontend/utils/soundManager.ts` - Extend with background music capabilities
- `frontend/types/index.ts` - Add music-related TypeScript types

**Actions:**
1. Add background music properties to SoundManager class:
   - `private backgroundMusic: Map<string, Audio.Sound>`
   - `private currentBackgroundTrack: string | null`
   - `private musicVolume: number`
   - `private musicEnabled: boolean`

2. Add background music methods to SoundManager:
   - `async loadBackgroundMusic(trackName: string, filePath: any)`
   - `async playBackgroundMusic(trackName: string, loop: boolean = true)`
   - `async stopBackgroundMusic()`
   - `async pauseBackgroundMusic()`
   - `async resumeBackgroundMusic()`
   - `setMusicVolume(volume: number)`
   - `setMusicEnabled(enabled: boolean)`

3. Add TypeScript types for music system:
   - `MusicTrack` interface
   - `BackgroundMusicState` interface
   - `AudioSettings` interface

### Phase 2: Music Assets & Loading
**Files to alter:**
- `frontend/assets/music/` - Create new directory for music files
- `frontend/utils/soundManager.ts` - Add music file loading

**Actions:**
1. Create music assets directory structure:
   - `frontend/assets/music/lobby-music.mp3`
   - `frontend/assets/music/room-music.mp3`
   - `frontend/assets/music/game-action-music.mp3`
   - `frontend/assets/music/victory-music.mp3`
   - `frontend/assets/music/defeat-music.mp3`

2. Extend SoundManager initialization:
   - Modify `initialize()` method to load background music tracks
   - Add error handling for music loading failures
   - Ensure music loading doesn't block sound effects initialization

3. Add music preloading strategy:
   - Load lobby music on app start
   - Lazy load other tracks when needed
   - Implement unloading of unused tracks

### Phase 3: State Management Integration
**Files to alter:**
- `frontend/store/gameStore.ts` - Add music state management
- `frontend/hooks/useBackgroundMusic.ts` - Create new hook for music control

**Actions:**
1. Add music state to gameStore:
   - `currentMusicTrack: string | null`
   - `musicEnabled: boolean`
   - `musicVolume: number`
   - `isMusicLoading: boolean`

2. Add music actions to gameStore:
   - `setCurrentMusicTrack(track: string | null)`
   - `setMusicEnabled(enabled: boolean)`
   - `setMusicVolume(volume: number)`
   - `setIsMusicLoading(loading: boolean)`

3. Create useBackgroundMusic hook:
   - `playMusicForScreen(screenName: string)`
   - `stopMusic()`
   - `toggleMusicEnabled()`
   - `setVolume(volume: number)`

### Phase 4: Screen Integration
**Files to alter:**
- `frontend/app/lobby/index.tsx` - Add lobby music
- `frontend/app/room/index.tsx` - Add room waiting music
- `frontend/app/encoder-game/index.tsx` - Add game action music
- `frontend/app/decoder-game/index.tsx` - Add game action music
- `frontend/app/game-end/index.tsx` - Add victory/defeat music

**Actions:**
1. Add music to lobby screen:
   - Import and use `useBackgroundMusic` hook
   - Play lobby music on component mount
   - Stop music on component unmount

2. Add music to room screen:
   - Play calm waiting music
   - Transition to lobby music when leaving

3. Add music to game screens:
   - Play action/tension music during gameplay
   - Ensure music doesn't interfere with turn-based audio cues

4. Add music to game end screen:
   - Play victory music for human wins
   - Play defeat music for AI wins
   - Handle music transitions properly

### Phase 5: App Lifecycle Integration
**Files to alter:**
- `frontend/app/index.tsx` - Add app-level music management
- `frontend/app/_layout.tsx` - Handle app backgrounding

**Actions:**
1. Add app-level music initialization:
   - Initialize music system with sound manager
   - Set default music preferences
   - Handle initial screen music

2. Add app lifecycle handlers:
   - Pause music when app goes to background
   - Resume music when app comes to foreground
   - Stop music on app termination

3. Add error boundary for music:
   - Ensure music failures don't crash the app
   - Provide fallback behavior when music system fails

### Phase 6: User Preferences & Polish
**Files to alter:**
- `frontend/app/components/SettingsModal.tsx` - Create new settings component
- `frontend/hooks/useSettings.ts` - Create settings hook
- `frontend/utils/audioUtils.ts` - Add audio utility functions

**Actions:**
1. Create settings modal for audio preferences:
   - Music enabled/disabled toggle
   - Music volume slider
   - Sound effects volume slider
   - Master mute option

2. Add settings persistence:
   - Save audio preferences to AsyncStorage
   - Load preferences on app start
   - Apply preferences to audio system

3. Add audio transition effects:
   - Fade in/out for music transitions
   - Cross-fade between different tracks
   - Smooth volume adjustments

4. Add accessibility features:
   - Audio settings for users with hearing sensitivity
   - Visual indicators for audio state
   - Proper labeling for screen readers

### Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
**Files to test:**
- All game screens with background music
- All existing sound effects
- App performance with music playing
- Memory usage during extended gameplay

**Actions:**
1. Comprehensive audio testing:
   - Test all screen transitions with music
   - Verify sound effects still work correctly
   - Test rapid screen navigation
   - Test app backgrounding/foregrounding

2. Performance testing:
   - Monitor memory usage with music playing
   - Test battery impact
   - Verify smooth gameplay with music
   - Test on lower-end devices

3. Platform-specific testing:
   - Test iOS silent mode behavior
   - Test Android audio focus handling
   - Test with phone calls/notifications
   - Test with other audio apps

4. Edge case testing:
   - Test with poor network connectivity
   - Test with low memory conditions
   - Test rapid game state changes
   - Test music system recovery from errors

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Background music plays contextually based on game screens
- [ ] Existing click and send sounds work without interference
- [ ] Music respects device silent mode and user preferences
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance degradation
- [ ] Smooth transitions between different music tracks
- [ ] Graceful error handling for music loading failures
- [ ] All tests pass on both iOS and Android platforms

## Rollback Plan
If any phase causes critical issues:
1. Revert to the last working commit
2. Disable music system by setting `musicEnabled: false` in gameStore
3. Add feature flag to completely bypass music loading if needed
4. Keep existing sound effects system completely isolated and functional
