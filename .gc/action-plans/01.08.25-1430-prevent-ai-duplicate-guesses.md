# Action Plan: Prevent AI Duplicate Guesses Implementation

**Date:** January 8, 2025 14:30 EST  
**Goal:** Implement a system to prevent the AI from repeating any guess that has been previously attempted (by AI or users) within a game round.

## Overall Goal

Modify the OpenAI service to extract all previous guesses from the conversation history and inject them into the tool call description to explicitly prevent the AI from repeating any word that has already been guessed in the current game round.

## Regression Risk Analysis

### High Risk Areas
- **OpenAI API calls**: Changes to tool definition could break structured outputs
- **Game flow**: AI response failures could break turn advancement
- **Type safety**: New extraction logic must handle all Turn types correctly

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Preserve existing tool structure**: Only modify the description field, not the schema
- **Add comprehensive error handling**: Graceful fallback if guess extraction fails
- **Extensive testing**: Test with various conversation history scenarios
- **Gradual rollout**: Test in isolation before integrating with game handlers

## Implementation Actions

### 1. Create Previous Guesses Extraction Logic
**File:** `backend/openai/services/openai.ts`
- Add method `extractPreviousGuesses(turns: Turn[]): string[]`
- Extract guesses from `ai_analysis` turns (`.guess` property)
- Extract guesses from `encoder_guess` turns (`.guess` property)
- Return array of unique lowercase strings

### 2. Update analyzeConversation Method
**File:** `backend/openai/services/openai.ts`
- Extract previous guesses at start of method
- Add console logging to verify previousGuesses array contents
- Template previousGuesses into existing tool description
- Use updated tool in OpenAI API call

### 3. Create Tests
**File:** `backend/openai/test-openai.ts`
- Add test scenario with repeated AI guesses
- Add test scenario with repeated user guesses  
- Add test scenario with mixed AI/user repeated guesses
- Add test scenario with empty conversation history
- Verify AI never repeats guesses in test outputs

### 4. Add Integration Tests
**File:** `backend/tests/aiService.test.ts`
- Test extraction logic with various Turn combinations
- Mock OpenAI responses to verify guess uniqueness

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Extraction Logic Implementation
```typescript
// In OpenAIService class
private extractPreviousGuesses(turns: Turn[]): string[] {
  const guesses: string[] = [];
  
  for (const turn of turns) {
    if (turn.type === 'ai_analysis' && turn.guess) {
      guesses.push(turn.guess.toLowerCase().trim());
    } else if (turn.type === 'encoder_guess' && turn.guess) {
      guesses.push(turn.guess.toLowerCase().trim());
    }
  }
  
  // Return unique guesses only
  return [...new Set(guesses)];
}
```

### Step 2: Update analyzeConversation Method
```typescript
// In analyzeConversation method
async analyzeConversation(turns: Turn[]): Promise<AIResponse> {
  try {
    // Extract previous guesses
    const previousGuesses = this.extractPreviousGuesses(turns);
    console.log(`[DEBUG] Previous guesses extracted:`, previousGuesses);
    
    // Create avoidance text for tool description
    const avoidanceText = previousGuesses.length > 0 
      ? ` CRITICAL: Must NOT be any of these previously guessed words: ${previousGuesses.join(', ')}`
      : '';
    
    // Update tool description with previous guesses
    const ANALYZE_CONVERSATION_TOOL = {
      type: "function" as const,
      function: {
        name: 'analyze_conversation',
        description: 'Analyze the conversation and provide thinking steps and a guess for the secret word',
        parameters: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            thinking: {
              type: 'array',
              items: { type: 'string' },
              description: 'Exactly 4 sentences of AI thinking, max 12 words each'
            },
            guess: {
              type: 'string',
              description: `Single lowercase word 3-12 characters, must be a regular everyday word.${avoidanceText}`
            }
          },
          required: ['thinking', 'guess'],
          additionalProperties: false
        },
        strict: true
      }
    };
    
    // Format conversation (existing logic)
    const conversationHistory = turns.map(/* existing mapping */);
    
    // Make API call with updated tool
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
        { role: 'user', content: conversationHistory }
      ],
      tools: [ANALYZE_CONVERSATION_TOOL],
      tool_choice: { type: "function", function: { name: "analyze_conversation" } }
    });
    
    // Rest of existing logic...
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test guess extraction with various conversation histories
- Test edge cases (empty history, no guesses)

### Integration Tests  
- Test full AI service with repeated guesses
- Verify AI never returns duplicate guesses

### Manual Testing
- Create test games with intentional guess repetition attempts
- Verify game flow continues properly with updated service
- Check console logs to confirm previousGuesses array is built correctly

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: AI never repeats a guess that appears in conversation history
2. **Robust**: System handles malformed data gracefully
3. **Performance**: No significant impact on response times
4. **Maintainable**: Code is clean and well-documented
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert `backend/openai/services/openai.ts` to original state
2. Remove `extractPreviousGuesses` method
3. Restore original tool description without avoidance text
4. Re-run existing tests to verify functionality restored
