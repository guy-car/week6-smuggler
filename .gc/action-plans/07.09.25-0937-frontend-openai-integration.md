# Frontend OpenAI Integration Action Plan

## Overall Goal
Integrate the frontend with the OpenAI-enabled backend by updating the WebSocket event handling and game state management to support the new Turn-based system with AI analysis.

## Regression Risk Analysis

### Identified Risks
1. **Game Flow Disruption**
   - Current game flow relies on specific event sequence
   - Changes to turn types could break existing game logic
   - Mitigation: Implement changes incrementally, maintain backward compatibility

2. **State Management Inconsistency**
   - Frontend store uses different turn types than backend
   - Role naming mismatch (encryptor/decryptor vs outsider/insider)
   - Mitigation: Update types systematically, validate state transitions

3. **WebSocket Event Mismatch**
   - Event names and payloads need to match new backend structure
   - Mitigation: Update all event handlers in sync, add type validation

4. **User Experience Breaks**
   - UI components expect specific data structures
   - Screen transitions depend on current roles
   - Mitigation: Update UI components alongside state changes

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
1. Create comprehensive test scenarios
2. Implement changes in feature branches
3. Add type validation for WebSocket events
4. Test all game flow paths before deployment

## Action Items

### 1. Update Type Definitions
File: `frontend/store/gameStore.ts`
- [ ] Replace `Turn` type with new schema:
  ```typescript
  type Turn = 
    | { type: 'outsider_hint', content: string }
    | { type: 'ai_analysis', thinking: string[], guess: string }
    | { type: 'insider_guess', guess: string }
  ```
- [ ] Update role types from 'encryptor'/'decryptor' to 'outsider'/'insider'
- [ ] Add AI response types for thinking steps

### 2. Update WebSocket Event Handlers
File: `frontend/services/websocket.ts`
- [ ] Update 'ai_response' event handler:
  ```typescript
  socket.on('ai_response', (data: { 
    turn: { 
      type: 'ai_analysis',
      thinking: string[],
      guess: string 
    },
    currentTurn: string
  }) => {
    // Update store with AI analysis
  });
  ```
- [ ] Remove 'game:aiThinking' and 'game:aiGuess' events
- [ ] Update message handling to use new turn types
- [ ] Update role-specific events to use 'outsider'/'insider'

### 3. Update Game Store Actions
File: `frontend/store/gameStore.ts`
- [ ] Update addTurn action to handle new turn types
- [ ] Modify setPlayerRole to use new role types
- [ ] Add actions for AI thinking steps
- [ ] Update conversation history management

### 4. Update UI Components
Files in `frontend/app/`:
- [ ] Update `encoder.tsx` to `outsider.tsx`:
  - Rename component
  - Update role checks
  - Update message sending
- [ ] Update `decoder.tsx` to `insider.tsx`:
  - Rename component
  - Update role checks
  - Update guess submission
- [ ] Update navigation based on new roles
- [ ] Update turn display for AI thinking steps

### 5. Update Game Flow Logic
Files: Various frontend components
- [ ] Update turn validation
- [ ] Update role-based permissions
- [ ] Update game end conditions
- [ ] Update score tracking

### 6. Testing Plan
1. Test WebSocket Events:
   - AI response handling
   - Turn transitions
   - Role assignments
   - Game state updates

2. Test Game Flow:
   - Complete game cycle
   - AI thinking display
   - Role transitions
   - Error handling

3. Test Edge Cases:
   - Disconnection handling
   - Invalid turn attempts
   - Game state recovery

## Implementation Order

1. Start with type definitions (minimal risk)
2. Update game store (foundation for other changes)
3. Update WebSocket handlers (core functionality)
4. Update UI components (user-facing changes)
5. Implement testing
6. Deploy changes

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Frontend successfully receives and displays AI responses
2. ✅ Game flow maintains correct turn order
3. ✅ UI correctly shows AI thinking steps
4. ✅ Role transitions work as expected
5. ✅ Game state remains consistent
6. ✅ All tests pass
7. ✅ No regression in existing functionality
