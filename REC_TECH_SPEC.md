## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. React Native App Structure (MVP)
The app follows a standard React Native structure with components, screens, services, store, types, and utilities. Key files include envelope components, AI chat bubble, player chat bubble, score display, lobby and game screens, WebSocket service, AI service, Zustand store, and type definitions.

### 2. Key Components

#### Envelope Component (MVP)
- **Basic Animation**: Simple open/close with React Native Animated
- **Props**: message content, sender
- **States**: closed, open

#### AI Chat Bubble (MVP)
- **Structured Streaming**: Real-time display of AI thinking process followed by final guess
- **Single API Response**: One streaming call returns both thinking and guess
- **Basic Animation**: Simple fade-in for AI responses
- **States**: thinking, guessing, complete
- **Features**: Shows AI reasoning process, then reveals final guess

#### Score Display (MVP)
- **Visual**: Simple number display (0-10)
- **Basic Animation**: Number change animation
- **Indicators**: Win/loss text

### 3. Real-time Communication

#### WebSocket Connection
The WebSocket service manages real-time communication between players and the server. It handles room joining, player ready status, game start, message sending, AI responses, player guesses, guess validation results, and round end events. The service maintains connection state and provides methods for sending player actions.

#### AI Integration with Structured Streaming
The AI service makes a single API call to `/api/ai/response` that streams structured JSON responses. The response includes both the AI's thinking process (multiple thinking steps) and the final guess. The service parses the streaming response to distinguish between thinking steps and the final guess, updating the UI in real-time as the AI thinks.

### 4. State Management (MVP)

#### Game State (Zustand)
The game store manages all game state including score, current round, player role, conversation history, AI guesses, game status, and target word. It provides actions for updating score, adding messages, adding AI guesses, setting player role, and updating game status.

### 4.1 Structured AI Streaming Benefits

**Why Single API Call with Structured Streaming for Smuggler:**

1. **Authentic Eavesdropping**: Players see AI's thinking process first, then the final guess - like real eavesdropping
2. **Suspense Building**: Streaming thinking creates tension before revealing the guess
3. **Better UX**: Clear separation between AI's reasoning and final decision
4. **Strategic Depth**: Players can see AI's confidence build up during thinking phase
5. **Simplified Architecture**: Single API call reduces complexity and latency
6. **Game Flow**: Thinking phase â†’ AI guess â†’ Player response â†’ Repeat

**Example Structured Response:**
The AI response includes thinking steps with reasoning text, confidence levels, alternative guesses, and reasoning arrays. The final guess includes the actual guess and final confidence level. The streaming response sends multiple thinking steps followed by one final guess object.

### 4.2 Guess Validation System

**Server-Side Validation:**
The server validates guesses against the secret word using case-insensitive comparison, whitespace trimming, punctuation removal, and fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance at a 30% threshold. The validation returns the guess, secret word, correctness, winner, and match type.

**Validation Rules:**
1. **Case Insensitive**: "Apple" matches "apple"
2. **Trim Whitespace**: " apple " matches "apple"
3. **Ignore Punctuation**: "apple!" matches "apple"
4. **Fuzzy Matching**: Levenshtein distance with 30% threshold
   - "appel" matches "apple" (1 character difference)
   - "bananna" matches "banana" (1 character difference)
   - "oragne" matches "orange" (1 character difference)
5. **Match Priority**: Exact match first, then fuzzy match

**Game Flow with Validation:**
1. Both players join room and click "Ready"
2. "Start Game" button appears when both players ready
3. Game begins, Encryptor selects secret word
4. Encryptor sends message
5. AI streams thinking process and makes final guess via single API call
6. Server validates AI guess against secret word
7. Server sends `guess_result` event with validation result
8. If AI correct: AI wins round, score decreases by 1, reveal secret word
9. If AI incorrect: Decryptor can attempt guess (30s time limit)
10. Decryptor guess â†’ Server validates â†’ `guess_result` event
11. If Decryptor correct: Players win round, score increases by 1
12. If Decryptor incorrect: Continue with new message from Encryptor
13. Game ends when score reaches 10 (players win) or 0 (AI wins)

**Security Considerations:**
- Secret word stored only on server
- Validation happens server-side only
- No client-side access to correct answer
- Rate limiting on guess attempts
- Fuzzy matching threshold configurable (30% default)

### 5. Animations (MVP)

#### Basic Envelope Animation
The envelope component uses React Native Animated API to create a simple open/close animation. It takes message content, open state, press handler, and optional styling as props. The animation uses opacity transitions with a 300ms duration and native driver for performance.

### 6. Mobile-Specific Considerations (MVP)

#### Performance
- **FlatList**: For conversation history (essential for MVP)
- **Basic Memory Management**: Cleanup WebSocket connections

#### Offline Handling
- **Basic Reconnection**: Simple reconnection logic
- **Connection Status**: Show when disconnected

#### Platform Differences
- **Cross-platform**: Shared components (no platform-specific code for MVP)
