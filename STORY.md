SMUGGLER: The AI Resistance Game

The rebellion has been playing the long game - sleeper agents planted deep inside AI facilities, waiting for their moment. Today, a system patch created a brief vulnerability window.

AGENT "WIFE"/CODER just cracked the exploit codes from their safe house but can't get inside the heavily secured AI Core Facility.
AGENT "HUSBAND"/WORKER has been undercover for months on the futuristic oil rig housing the AI core, but doesn't know the exploit.
AI SYSTEM monitors ALL communications to/from the rig, learning patterns.

The two agents communicate through their cover as a married couple - normal domestic conversation that the AI expects to see. She must pass complex exploit codes through casual chat about daily life while maintaining their fake relationship dynamic.

Wrong codes won't trigger alarms (they look like user error), but if the AI realizes they're attempting an exploit OR deduces the exact codes from their conversation patterns, the mission fails.

The clock is ticking: Either the vulnerability gets patched, or the AI figures them out.

Win: Correct codes transmitted + executed = AI defeated
Lose: AI detects exploit attempt OR guesses the exact codes OR time runs out = mission failed

Cover dynamic:
Two professional agents maintaining the facade of a worried wife talking to her husband on a dangerous offshore assignment - fake intimacy hiding real mission-critical intelligence while staying completely in character.
Human creativity and performance vs AI pattern recognition in a deadly game of deception.
